Kevoree Modeling Optimization Framework
=======

## Please, Pimp my model !

Optimizing several criteria is a difficult task in computer science.<br />
Often it relies on the problem encoding asking you a very strong knowledge in genetic or constraint programming or other evolutionary approaches.<br />
We believe that it should be simplified to empower many applications by the evolutionary approach without doing a Ph.D.< br />
The Kevoree Modeling Optimization Framework is developed following these simple ideas
